(1) kgetc will sleep the current process. If P0 is slept, and all other process are slept, there are no processes left to wake up the other processes.

(2) 6: Call kgetc
    5: when theres no data, sleep here
	1: interrupt happens, jump to vector table. Vector Table sets PC to irq_handler_addr
	2: irq_handler subtracts 4 from the link register. saves registers. Calls IRQ_handler
	3: IRQ_handler runs, calls kbd_handler
	4: kbd_handler runs, calls wakeup
	5: wake up again, run kgetc, now that we have data we can continue. Data is read and kgetc ends
	
	
(3) kgetc will sleep the current process. The next process now runs and also calls kgetc. 
Because the sleep list is a queue, aka first in first out, the first process to sleep will
get invoked, meaning the first process will read. Then, the next process gets called,
and there's no data left, so the next process doesn't read anything. This will continue until
a full line is read in the first process.

(4) Because if the interrupt handler is slept, then there is nothing to wake up the main process, and the processes sleep forever.
